# Sieve-of-eratosthenes
Implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes up to 103 with underlying vectors. The numbers all start out white, and turn green if prime, or red if composite. Uses the Stanford Graphics libraries (provided in the repository) to create the graphics.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm of determining prime numbers quickly.
